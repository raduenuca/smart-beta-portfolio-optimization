# Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization
*Udacity - AI for Trading Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
* Build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. 
* Calculate the tracking error against the index to find out how well the smart beta portfolio did
* Build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. 
* Rebalance the portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance. 
* Use the turn over metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. 

For the dataset, the end of day from Quotemedia is used.
